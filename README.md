# Elevate Labs - Python Developer Internship - Task 1

## Task: Build a Calculator CLI App

This repository contains the solution for Task 1 of the Elevate Labs Python Developer Internship.

### Objective
[cite_start]The objective was to create a command-line calculator that supports basic arithmetic operations[cite: 4].

### Features
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)
* [cite_start]**Looping Menu**: The application runs in a loop, allowing the user to perform multiple calculations until they choose to exit[cite: 10].
